AWS IAM Least Privilege Access Project

This project demonstrates hands-on implementation of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Least Privilege Access as part of my professional development in cloud security.

Project Goal
To create a secure, role-based access system in AWS that ensures users have only the permissions they need to perform their jobsâ€”no more, no less.

Roles Implemented
1. Developer: Access only to development resources  
2. Read-Only Auditor: View-only access for auditing  
3. S3 Manager: Manage specific S3 buckets  
4. EC2 Operator: Start/stop EC2 instances  

Key Accomplishments
1. Designed custom IAM policies for each role  
2. Created user groups and test accounts for practical validation  
3. Applied least privilege principles to reduce security risk  
4. Verified access controls across multiple AWS services  

Skills Demonstrated
1. AWS IAM policy creation and role management  
2. Cloud security best practices  
3. Secure infrastructure deployment in AWS  
4. Hands-on experience with EC2, S3 and IAM  

This project is a demonstration of my readiness to contribute to a cloud security or cloud infrastructure team, delivering secure and well-structured AWS environments.
